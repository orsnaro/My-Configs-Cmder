 (also $t is used to to multiple commands in alias, replaces '&&' or ';'  )


$*
---> get all parameters in alias  ( u can get only one parameter $1)
-->OR u can use up to 10 parameters in terminl from $1 to $9
--> SOME TERMINALS CAN ACCEPT MORE USING ${NUM OF PARAMS}

--> more special chars for cmder alias : https://stackoverflow.com/a/59397138


`command | clip   OR clip < filename.txt`

`CHDIR /d  drive: path`

`git merge branch_to_merge -m "Merge msg"`
--> to merge a branch with another branch (will not delete any of the two brancheds)

get letter meaning :

M: The file has been modified.
A: The file has been added to the index.
D: The file has been deleted from the working tree.
R: The file has been renamed.
C: The file has been copied.
U: The file is unmerged, meaning it has conflicts that need to be resolved.
!: file has merge conflict that need to be manually done ( both modified in local and remote)

# -----------------(power shell & CMD)-----------------IMPORTANT only
```
`help <ur command>`
or `<ur command> /?`
or `<ur command>  --help`
--> to read documentaion for the command u want (last one for cmder and linux only)

to use help in cmd

*note:  using '/' or '\' is interchangable in cmd -most if time- also 'tab' will autocomplete ur command

`code`
--> opens vs code

`start filename.exe`
--> (open any exe in directory)

`start/min filename.exe`
--> (start any exe minimized)

`command |clip   OR    clip <filename.txt`
---> copy terminal  or any .txt to clip board

`type nul > filename.txt`
'dir "" > filename.txt'
---> to make new .txt file
---> to write to file use (@echo ur text >> filename.txt) '>>' to append in new line not to overwrite
---> also check cat command and cp or copy on alzero crash course (link is down).

`cd .\folder1\folder2`
 --> change directory to a one inside ur current directory (dont miss dot in begining)

`cd C:\folder1\folder2`
 --> change directory to a totally different one (u need to type full path starting from partition letter )

`cd ..`
--> go back in directory only one location ( too location would be 'cd ..\..')

`CHDIR /d  drive: path`
--> (to change to another partion or drive)

`mkdir .\foldername`
--> make new folder inside current directory

`Remove-Item 'D:\temp\Test Folder1`
--> removes the folder but it must be empty (to force remove append -recurse)

`New-Item filename.txt -ItemType file`
--> make a new file (u can make it .cpp and it will open in txt normally)

`New-Item filename.txt -path [UR FULL PATH HERE] -ItemType file`
--> make a new file in another dir (u can make it .cpp and it will open in txt normally)

`1..5 | foreach { new-item "FILENAME$_.txt" }`
--> ***POWER SHELL ONLY!*** --> make multiple new files -5 in this example -  (1st file = FILENAME1 2nd  file= FILENAME2 ...)(make sure to apend by '$_' and if any thing comes after it put space between them)

`1..5 | foreach { new-item -path [UR FULL PATH] }`
-->multiple files in another dir (u can make an file typ like .cpp) ***POWER SHELL ONLY!***

`get-childitem`
--> will list all content -files and folders- inside current directory

`g++ filname.cpp -o filename.exe' ; .\filename.exe`
--> ***POWER SHELL ONLY!*** (compile and run filname.exe in one statement)(filename.exe could be written only filename)
--> to do same in cmd in one command use '&&' instead of ';' (.\filename --> here'\' is NOT interchangable with '/')

`g++ -c filname.cpp -o filename.exe' ; .\filename.exe`
---> '-c' to just only compile filname not link it (output file is filename.o)

====> for more cpp commands in cmd : https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-cmd-commands-every-windows-user-know/

\```batch
for /l %x in (1, 1, 100) do (
echo %x

echo any thing

)
\```

--> for loop that works in cmder for more type for /?
--> if used in batch file use double percent '%%' before var name

'notepad'
--> open standard notepad

`cls`
--> clears all cmd screen

`Measure-Command {start-process 'FILE U WANT TO EXECUTE no qoutes!' -Wait}`
----> to calc execution time taken in this .exe file runtime.

====> on echo new line either using echo. or envisible 255 arg using alt+255

# -----------------(bash in ubuntu)-----------------IMPORTANT only
```

`pwd`
-> (echo current dir also use env. var. `~`)

`export var=any-val`
-> (makes env. var. also could use set)

`printenv`
-> (prints all env. variables: set shows variables also but along with many non-needed scripts/info. Not good like 'set' in cmder)

`unset env_variable`
-> (to remove env. variable  'set env_var=' does not delete it like it does in cmder. It jsut makes variable empty)

`htop`
-> (call it task maneger of  ubuntu & unix <3 btw made by someone called hisham)

`iotop`
-> (similar to htop but stats: provides more deatails about disk usage by processes)

`sudo apt-get -y install app-name `
-> ( installs apps and auto  'yes' to all prompts )

`sudo shutdown -r now`
-> (reboots the system)

`chmod u+x filename.sh`
-> (chmod modifies permissions of a file: this one gives right to exec'x' and owmer permission 'u')

`kill task-id`
-> (kills task by pid)

`pkill task-name`
-> ( kills task by name )

`ps`
-> (print running processes that are attached to terminal only)

`ps -e`
-> (print all running processes even ones not attached to terminal 'runs in background')

`ll`
-> (modified 'ls' command to show more verbose details on files and dirs in current directory)

`tmux ls`
-> to see all tmux sessions and which one you're attached to

`tmux new -d -s tmux_session_nam  'command-to-run-at-start'`
-> (-s session-name is optional. Also command to start session with  is optional.  must be inside single qotation)
-> (-d to start detached session with out it you attach to the new made tmux session)
-> (most power full command to isolate and silence a process and keep it working even if shell is closed. somtimes  may be risky: cant exit cmder/win-terminal-preview proberly)

`tmux kill-session -t  session-num or name`
-> (to kill a session of tmux)

`&` at end of commands
-> makes commands run in background ex : ./start_silent.sh &

`nohup comnd.sh`  and  `comnd.sh & disown`
-> also makes command run in background but kinda more detached ( search more on it )


`drwx-rwx-rwx` or `d-7
-> this permission says that its a dir and owner group and others all have read write execute permissons
x -> this permission has value '001' or in dec 1 and its an execution permission
w -> //   //         //   //   '010' or in dec 2 and its an write permission
r -> //   //         //   //   '100' or in dec 4 and its a  read permision
d -> not actual permission but tells us that this is a `dir` or if '-' instead of 'd' then its a `file`

u -> in `chmod` command means owner
g -> in `chmod` command means group
o -> in `chomd` command means others

`chmod ugo+rwx foo.sh`
-> this example comand give all fileOwner-group-others the permission to read write and execute
-> in numeric values we code write `chmod 777 foo.sh` this does same as prev. command
```


# -----------------(tmux in bash ubuntu)-----------------IMPORTANT only
```
ctrl + b c
-> (tabbing: new tab )(press them seperatly)

ctrl + b <tab num>
-> (switches to tab)

ctrl + b %
->(panning: split a new pan to right)

ctrl + b hold ‚Üí
-> (resize the pane)

ctrl + b ‚Üí
-> ( switch to the right pan  also : ctrl+b+left moves to the left pan)

ctrl + b "
-> (split down)

ctrl + b + '
-> (searches tab by name and switches to it)

 exit
-> (gets out of program. if in bash exits tmux)
```
